ABOUT:

LIMSIM is currently driven based on:
    •	A-block Surface water allocation rules as proportions of MALF (minimum flows and total allocation)
    •	REC reach characteristics that are fixed and natural
    •	REC reach land cover characteristics that may potentially change
LIMSIM attributes that are currently modelled:
    1.	The percentage of time abstraction is stopped due to minimum flows (%)
    2.	The percentage of time abstraction is restricted due to management flows (%)
    3.	The reliability of the take (% of total demand taken)
    4.	The percentage of the upstream irrigable area irrigated
    5.	The fraction of the allocated water used
    6.	Clarity
    7.	MCI 
    8.	Reduction in River Width
    9.	Periphyton: mean filaments; Max annual Filaments; mean mats max; annual mats (Snelder)
    10.	Change in various fish species habitat
“Internal” attributes used in LIMSIM include:
    1.	Flow duration curves (NIWA)
    2.	Flow statistics (MALF, BFI, FREx, nNeg, Reversals) (NIWA)
    3.	Change in Flow statistics (Aqualinc)
    4.	Water quality variables (Mean: DRP, TN, NO3N, TP, E.Coli) (McDowell/Snelder)
    a.	NOTE: water quality variables now are driven by LAND COVER.  We estimate changes in Land Use/Management by moving within the confidence intervals of these models.
